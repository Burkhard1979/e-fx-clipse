This is a plugin for Eclipse which using JavaFX projects in your Eclipse. It includes tooling and runtime for Eclipse and OSGi. This is the only plugin for Eclipse which supports JavaFX.



## Installation for Eclipse 4.2 and 3.8 ##
 
- See a [wiki here](http://www.efxclipse.org/install.html) and **make sure** you use [Java 7](http://www.java.com) with latest update. Minimum version is Java 7 update 7.

Just add one of the following update sites in eclipse.

- For **stable** builds use : http://downloads.efxclipse.org/p2-repos/releases/latest/

- For **nightly** builds use : http://www.efxclipse.org/p2-repos/nightly/site/

You can also download preconfigured distributions. [Look here](http://www.efxclipse.org/install.html#for-the-lazy).

**Java 8 users:**
> If you are living on the edge with JDK8 b75 or later, you'll need the latest nightly builds of e(fx)clipse since starting with b75 JavaFX will be on the extension classpath of your JDK8/JRE8. For autocompletion to work properly in this case, you need to modify your installed JRE such that the Javadoc location for JavaFX points to a local Javadoc resource as shown in this [screenshot](http://www.efxclipse.org/jfx_javadoc.png). We are going to find a better solution for this once the source code is shipped with the JDK.
